# Introduction

This API is documented in **OpenAPI format**. In addition to standard OpenAPI
syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance
with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). And that allows cross-domain
communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which
makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on
any site.

# Authentication

This API uses OAuth2 for authentication. OAuth2 is an open protocol to allow
secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile, and
desktop applications.
